Learning React Native from scratch to develop this application. 
My resource utilization for this project includes:

How works the application:
1) At the beginning, each user is introduced to the EPF Majors through the Home Screen, which includes the following buttons:
   a) Campus information
   b) Formation information
   c) Test start
   d) Newsletter (not working for the moment)
